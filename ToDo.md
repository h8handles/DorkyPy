# Ultimate Goal

The plan here is to work on an actual project and accomplish something.
That end somethimg would be a script to take the google hacking database
 and search google for those dorks. My plan is for this to be a multi script
 tool with the ability to specify target arguments for Red teamers and bug bounty 
hunters. This is my first major project but i have a good idea of what I want to accomplish.



# Where are we?
So far, i have been able to get an 
extremely ugly output of the first page of the 
Ghdb on exploitdb.com. I am having trouble 
with scraping the results from google
They are not fans of what the presume as
Bots.

# Todo list (wip)

## Fixes And Feats.

I need to upload my google scrape once roughly working
Solve the captcha bot detect
Randomize user agent
(Pipe dream)Chart results to some form of document beyond txt.
But still get a nice formated text outout as well.
